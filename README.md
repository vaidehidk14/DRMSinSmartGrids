Smart Grid focuses to fulfil increasing demand for electricity, by providing reliability, efficiency and sustainability. Grid which is self-healing, self-balancing and self-optimizing long distance transmission, and automated monitoring and analysis tools based on real-time data about weather, outage history, etc. This system can manage demand response actions either by decreasing demand through reduced voltage on the distribution network or regulators can ask consumers to change their electricity consumption patterns when supply is short.

Smart grid supports two-way traffic between electricity supplier and consumer, that means it takes response from the consumer to make the service more reliable and minimize the possibility of power disruptions. Demand response system consists of sensors for sensing the excessive load on the station and based on the system decision, it can either deny the services or divert the load to most strategically located station.
